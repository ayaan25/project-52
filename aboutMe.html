<h1>Information about origami designs</h1>
<br><h3>Origami is the art of paper-folding. Its name derives from Japanese words ori (“folding”) and kami (“paper”).
     Traditional origami consists of folding a single sheet of square paper (often with a colored side) into a sculpture without cutting,
      gluing, taping, or even marking it.</h3>
